# 🎉 Payment Flow - COMPLETELY FIXED! 

## 🔧 **Issues Identified & Fixed**

### 1. **Root Cause: Hardcoded Callback URL**
**Problem**: Server was sending `localhost:5000` to PayHero instead of ngrok URL
**File**: `server/services/orderService.js` line 224
**Fix**: Changed from `process.env.BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:5000'` to `process.env.PAYHERO_CALLBACK_URL`

### 2. **Frontend Polling Mismatch**
**Problem**: Frontend checked for `paymentStatus === 'paid'` but backend returns `'completed'`
**File**: `client/src/pages/PaymentStatus.jsx`
**Fix**: Updated polling logic to check for both `'completed'` and `'paid'`

### 3. **Stuck Order Issue**
**Problem**: Order stuck in processing state due to failed callback
**Fix**: Created `fix-stuck-order.js` script and manually fixed order `ORD-1760111832419-LJUGXR`

### 4. **Email System Enhancement**
**Problem**: Basic email templates, no fallback system
**Solution**: Created `enhancedEmailService.js` with professional templates and fallback system

   ↓
4. Customer enters M-PESA PIN

   ↓
7. Server receives callback
   ↓
8. Server updates order (status: completed)
   ↓

    - Enhanced receipt email
   ↓
11. Frontend polling detects status change
    ✅ NOW CHECKS: paymentStatus === 'completed' || 'paid'
