fix(qr-codes): add backward compatibility and fix scanning issues

- Fix environment variable mismatch in payhero.js QR generation
  * Change QR_ENCRYPTION_SECRET to TICKET_QR_SECRET for consistency
  * Ensures new QR codes use correct secret from environment

- Add backward compatibility for legacy QR codes (30 existing tickets)
  * Support old AES-256-CBC encrypted format (iv:encrypted hex)
  * Support new compact JSON format with HMAC signature
  * Try multiple legacy secrets for decryption (current, default, old env var)
  * Verify old QR codes against stored ticket.qrCode field

- Update QR availability checks to support both formats
  * Check both ticket.qr (new) and ticket.qrCode (old) fields
  * Old tickets now show as having QR codes available

- Preserve existing QR codes for tickets already sent via email
  * Return existing qrCode for old tickets unless rotating
  * Ensures QR codes in app match what was sent in emails

- Enhance client-side QR code extraction and validation
  * Handle different ZXing result formats (getText, text, direct)
  * Trim whitespace from scanned QR codes
  * Validate QR string type and non-empty before sending
  * Add comprehensive error handling and logging

- Add comprehensive logging for debugging scanning issues
  * Log QR extraction, format detection, and verification steps
  * Log scan requests and responses on both client and server
  * Log decryption attempts and failures with details
  * Log QR code mismatches with prefixes for comparison

This ensures all existing QR codes (30 tickets already sent) continue to
work while new QR codes use the updated format. Scanning now supports
both old and new formats seamlessly.
