# Quick Fix for Checkout Issues (No Docker Required)

## Immediate Solution

The checkout validation issues have been fixed in the code. Here's how to get it working right now:

### 1. Start MongoDB Locally (Simplest Option)

```bash
# Install MongoDB if you don't have it
brew install mongodb-community

# Start MongoDB
brew services start mongodb/brew/mongodb-community

# Create database and user
mongosh
```

In MongoDB shell:
```javascript
use event_i
db.createUser({
  user: "admin", 
  pwd: "password123",
  roles: ["readWrite"]
})
exit
```

### 2. Seed the Database

```bash
cd /Users/brix/Documents/GitHub/MVPEVENT_i/server
npm run seed
```

### 3. Start the Server

```bash
npm start
```

### 4. Start the Client (in another terminal)

```bash
cd /Users/brix/Documents/GitHub/MVPEVENT_i/client
npm run dev
```

## What Was Fixed

1. **Event ID Issue**: Changed `currentEvent._id` to `currentEvent.id` in EventDetails.jsx
2. **Order Model**: Fixed `orderNumber` field requirement in Order.js  
3. **Ticket Validation**: Added dynamic ticket type generation in orderService.js
4. **Cart Validation**: Improved validation logic in checkoutSlice.js

## Test the Fix

1. Open http://localhost:3000 (or 3001 if 3000 is busy)
2. Navigate to an event (e.g., Summer Music Festival)
3. Add items to cart
4. Go to checkout
5. Fill in customer information
6. Submit - should now work without errors!

## Expected Result

You should see:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Order created successfully", 
  "data": {
    "orderId": "...",
    "orderNumber": "ORD-...",
    "pricing": {
      "subtotal": 179,
      "serviceFee": 9, 
      "total": 188,
      "currency": "KES"
    },
    "status": "pending"
  }
}
```

The cart should no longer be empty and validation should pass! ðŸŽ‰
