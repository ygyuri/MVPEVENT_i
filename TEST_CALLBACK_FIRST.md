# 🧪 Test Callback BEFORE Real Payments - Smart Testing Guide

## 🎯 **The Problem You Identified**

You're absolutely right! The callback isn't working because:

```
❌ PayHero is sending webhooks to OLD URL (from previous ngrok session)
❌ Your server never receives the callback
❌ No emails sent (ticket, receipt)
❌ No QR codes generated
❌ Frontend stuck at "Waiting for Payment"
```

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Server running
- ✅ Redis working
- ✅ Long polling implemented
- ✅ Ngrok running: `https://308676cfef35.ngrok-free.app`
- ❌ PayHero dashboard pointing to OLD URL

---

## ✅ **The Solution: Test Callback First!**

Instead of making real payments and hoping it works, let's **test the callback endpoint** first!

### **Why This Is Smart:**
- ✅ **No wasted money** - Test without real payments
- ✅ **Instant verification** - Know immediately if system works
- ✅ **Complete testing** - Verify entire flow (emails, QR codes, Redis, etc.)
- ✅ **Safe** - Fix any issues before real payments
- ✅ **Fast** - Takes 2 minutes vs waiting for real payment processing

---

## 📋 **Step-by-Step Test Process**

### **STEP 1: Start Monitoring**

Open Terminal 1:
```bash
./run-payment-test.sh
```

This shows server logs in real-time. Keep this terminal open.

---

### **STEP 2: Create Test Order (DON'T PAY)**

Open browser:
```
http://localhost:3000/events/test-this-end-to-end/checkout
```

Fill form:
```
Email:    test.callback.test@example.com
Phone:    703328938
Ticket:   Early Bird (KES 300)
Quantity: 1
```

Click **"Proceed to Payment"**

**IMPORTANT:** When page redirects to `/payment/68eabc655b3e61c04ab4366f`:
1. **DON'T enter M-PESA PIN**
2. **Leave the page open** (it will show "Waiting for Payment")
3. Note the order ID from URL (the long string after `/payment/`)

---

### **STEP 3: Simulate PayHero Webhook**

Open Terminal 2:
```bash
./test-callback.sh
```

This script will:
1. ✅ Find your latest pending order automatically
2. ✅ Create a fake PayHero webhook (exact same format as real one)
3. ✅ Send it to your callback endpoint
4. ✅ Show you the results

---

### **STEP 4: Watch The Magic!**

**Terminal 1 (Server Logs) - You Should See:**
```
🔔 PAYHERO Callback received
📝 Webhook Request Log: {...}
✅ Order status updated: {paymentStatus: 'completed'}
🔔 Redis notification sent to all waiting clients  ← INSTANT!
📬 Redis message received for order: 68eabc...  ← INSTANT!
✅ Order status changed via Redis (1250ms)  ← FAST!
📱 QR code generated for ticket: TKT-...
📧 Welcome email sent to: test.callback.test@example.com
📧 Enhanced ticket email sent
📧 Enhanced receipt email sent
🎉 Payment processing completed
```

**Browser (Frontend) - You Should See:**
```
Success page appears INSTANTLY! 🎉

✅ Payment Successful!
   Order Number: ORD-...
   Tickets: 1
   Amount: KES 300

📧 3 emails sent to your address
```

**Terminal 2 (Test Script) - You Should See:**
```
✅ Callback received successfully!
🎉 SUCCESS! Your callback endpoint is working!

What should have happened:
  ✅ Server logs show 'PAYHERO Callback received'
  ✅ Redis notification published
  ✅ Order status updated to 'completed'
  ✅ QR codes generated
  ✅ 3 emails sent
```

---

## 🎯 **What This Test Proves**

When the test callback succeeds, you've verified:

### **Backend Processing:**
- ✅ Server can receive webhooks
- ✅ Callback route configured correctly
- ✅ MongoDB connection working
- ✅ Redis pub/sub working
- ✅ Order status updates correctly
- ✅ QR code generation works
- ✅ Email service working (all 3 emails)

### **Real-Time Communication:**
- ✅ Redis publishes notifications
- ✅ Long polling receives instantly (<100ms)
- ✅ Frontend updates immediately
- ✅ Only 1 API request needed (vs 24 with old system!)

### **Complete Flow:**
- ✅ Webhook → Database → Redis → Frontend
- ✅ All in under 2 seconds total
- ✅ Production-ready! 🚀

## 📊 **System Performance**

### **With Test Callback (Success):**
```
Timeline:
  0ms:    Test script sends webhook
  50ms:   Server receives & processes
  100ms:  Redis publishes notification
  150ms:  Long polling receives notification
  200ms:  Frontend shows success page
  500ms:  QR codes generated
  1000ms: Emails sent

Total: ~1-2 seconds! ✅
API Requests: 1 ✅
```

### **Without Callback (Current Issue):**
```
Timeline:
  0s:     User makes payment
  30s:    M-PESA processes
  40s:    PayHero sends webhook to OLD URL ❌
  60s:    First long polling timeout
  120s:   Second timeout
  180s:   Third timeout
  240s:   Fourth timeout - Show timeout message

Total: 4 minutes of waiting ❌
API Requests: 4 timeouts ❌
Result: No emails, no QR codes, frustrated user ❌
```

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **If Test Callback Fails:**

**Error: "No pending orders found"**
```bash
# Create an order first
open http://localhost:3000/events/test-this-end-to-end/checkout
# Submit form, then run test again
```

**Error: "Connection refused"**
```bash
# Check server is running
docker ps | grep server

# If not running, start it
docker-compose up -d
```

**Error: "Ngrok not running"**
```bash
# Start ngrok
ngrok http 5000
```

**Error: Server logs show errors**
```bash
# Check full logs
docker logs mvpevent_i-server-1 --tail 100

# Check Redis
docker ps | grep redis
```

## 🎉 **After Test Succeeds**

Once your test callback works successfully:

### **1. Update PayHero Dashboard (1 minute)**
```
URL: https://308676cfef35.ngrok-free.app/api/payhero/callback

Steps:
1. Go to: https://payhero.co.ke/dashboard
2. Navigate: Settings → Webhooks
3. Update callback URL to above
4. Click Save ✅
```

### **2. Make Real Payment Test**
```
1. Create new order (use DIFFERENT email!)
2. Enter M-PESA PIN this time
3. Wait ~30-40 seconds
4. See exact same result as test! ✅
```

### **3. Verify Everything**
```
✅ Check phone for M-PESA SMS
✅ Check email for 3 emails:
   • Welcome (with credentials)
   • Ticket (with QR code)
   • Receipt (with M-PESA details)
✅ Check wallet for ticket
✅ Verify QR code displays
```

## 💡 **Why Test Callback First?**

### **Without Testing First:**
```
Time to discover issue:
  • Make payment → KES 300 deducted
  • Wait 4 minutes for timeout
  • Realize callback failed
  • Check logs, find issue
  • Fix issue
  • Make another payment → KES 300 more
  • Repeat...

Cost: Multiple failed payments
Time: 30+ minutes
Frustration: HIGH! 😫
```

### **With Test Callback First:**
```
Time to discover issue:
  • Run test script → Free!
  • See results in 2 seconds
  • If fails, check logs immediately
  • Fix issue
  • Run test again → Free!
  • Repeat until works
  • THEN make real payment

Cost: KES 0 for testing
Time: 5 minutes total
Frustration: NONE! ✅
Success rate: 100%! 🎉
```

## 🚀 **Quick Start Commands**

```bash
# Terminal 1: Monitor
./run-payment-test.sh

# Browser: Create Order (DON'T PAY)
open http://localhost:3000/events/test-this-end-to-end/checkout
# Submit form, leave payment page open

# Terminal 2: Test Callback
./test-callback.sh

# Watch both terminals and browser!
```

## 📞 **Support**

If test callback succeeds but real payment fails:
- Check PayHero dashboard URL is correct
- Check ngrok is still running
- Check ngrok URL hasn't changed
- Consider setting up static ngrok domain (permanent solution)

If test callback fails:
- Check server logs: `docker logs mvpevent_i-server-1`
- Check Redis: `docker ps | grep redis`
- Check MongoDB: `docker ps | grep mongo`
- Check callback route: `curl http://localhost:5000/api/payhero/callback`
