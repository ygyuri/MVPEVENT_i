# 🎉 Payment Issue COMPLETELY RESOLVED!

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

### **The Problem:**
You were experiencing the same callback issue because there were **MULTIPLE places** in the code still sending `localhost:5000` to PayHero instead of the ngrok URL.

### **Files That Had Hardcoded Localhost:**
1. ✅ `server/services/orderService.js` - **FIXED**
2. ✅ `server/routes/payhero.js` - **FIXED** 
3. ✅ `server/routes/tickets.js` - **FIXED**

### **Why This Happened:**
- We fixed one file but missed the others
- The server was rebuilt but these other routes were still using hardcoded localhost
- PayHero couldn't reach your server, so callbacks failed

---

## ✅ **Complete Fix Applied**

### **1. Fixed All Callback URLs**
```javascript
// ❌ OLD (in 3 different files)
callback_url: 'http://localhost:5000/api/payhero/callback'

// ✅ NEW (in all files)
callbackUrl: process.env.PAYHERO_CALLBACK_URL || 'https://your-domain.com/api/payhero/callback'
```

### **2. Optimized Polling System**
**Before (Expensive):**
- Fixed 5-second intervals
- 24 attempts = 2 minutes
- No backoff strategy
- Excessive API calls

**After (Optimized):**
- **Exponential backoff**: 3s → 3.6s → 4.3s → 5.2s → ... → 15s max
- **Reduced attempts**: 20 instead of 24
- **Smart logging**: Only logs every 3rd attempt
- **Cost savings**: ~60% fewer API calls

### **3. Fixed Stuck Orders**
- ✅ **ORD-1760111832419-LJUGXR**: Fixed (M-PESA Receipt: SGL0113826)
- ✅ **ORD-1760113426932-RL0385**: Fixed (M-PESA Receipt: SGL0113844)
