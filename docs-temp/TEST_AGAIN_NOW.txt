🐛 WHAT WENT WRONG
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Problem:  Server was sending LOCALHOST callback URL to PayHero
Result:   PayHero couldn't reach your server
Impact:   
  ❌ Payment went through on M-PESA
  ❌ But webhook never arrived
  ❌ Order stuck on "Processing Payment..."
  ❌ No QR codes generated
  ❌ No emails sent


✅ WHAT WE FIXED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Restarted server container
   ✅ Now using ngrok URL: https://125fb8a73e04.ngrok-free.app

2. Fixed your stuck order (ORD-1760109764136-AAZWTK)
   ✅ Status: processing → completed
   ✅ M-PESA Receipt: SGL0111478

3. Verified configuration
   ✅ Server callback URL: https://125fb8a73e04.ngrok-free.app/api/payhero/callback
   ✅ Ngrok running
   ✅ PayHero dashboard updated (you did this)
